# Adil Husain — About Me Website

This is a simple personal "About Me" website showing your Bachelor of Science studies and interest in coding/app development.

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

How to run:
1. Put these three files in the same folder.
2. Open index.html in any web browser.
3. The contact form currently saves messages to your browser's localStorage (no server).

Customize:
- Replace the placeholder email in index.html with your real email.
- Add your college name, year, and real project links.
- Change colors in styles.css by editing the --accent variable.

Publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push these files.
2. In the repository Settings > Pages, select the branch (main) and root folder to publish.
3. I can help create the repo and publish the site — tell me the desired repository name and owner (or give me permission to create it under your account).

Want me to:
- Add your real details now (email, college, projects)?
- Create a GitHub repo and publish to Pages (I will need the repository owner name)?
Tell me which and I'll do it next.
